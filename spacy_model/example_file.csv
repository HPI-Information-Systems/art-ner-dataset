As droll personalizations Meissonier included another poster announcing Le Peintre ridicule (The Ridiculous Painter) at a Théâtre du Boudoir et des Muses and a pasted-up notice reading “On demande un apprenti chez le citoyen Meissonier, peintre, rue de l’Homme-Armé” (“Apprentice wanted by the citizen Meissonier, painter, street of the Armed Man”).
Didier also owned A Man Drawing of 1855 (Dumas bought it at his death), which Meissonier dedicated specially with an inscription on the studio wall: “Meissonier à Poissy/H. Didier, rue de Hanovre.” In addition he owned a painting entitled The Little Nephew of Rameau (1858), a rare instance of Meissonier making a literary allusion, in this case to Diderot’s Le Neveu de Rameau. The painting was a variant on the smoker in a tavern,"

Making and appreciating art is another pleasure Meissonier features. This too was a popular theme in literature as well as art, of obvious personal relevance to Meissonier’s own experience. Sometimes, as in A Man Drawing, shown in 1855, or its elaboration, Painter at His Easel (Salon of 1857, Fig. 28), the artist works alone, privately exploring the process of creation. That he is an amateur of means is announced by his rich black frock coat and breeches and his curled and beribboned hair; the latter fellow must also be able to play the lute in the background.

likewise preoccupied in 1865, drawn to return to an etching in progress while wearing a long, red embroidered dressing gown and slippers (Fig. 2.9).
Other artists are shown with visitors, as in Painter Showing His Drawings (Salon of 1850-1, Fig. 30) or Painting Collectors (Salon of 1861, Fig. 31). Such paintings unmask the economic reality of an artist’s life, working not for self-fulfillment but for patrons, out of necessity. In Painting Collectors the artist, working informally in his dressing gown and without a wig,"

on a painting of such delicacy that he requires a maulstick, is crowded by three visitors, one leaning back expansively in judgment, one about to take snuff (and sneeze?), and the third inconsiderately obstructing our view of the canvas on which the artist toils. In the right background is another canvas, suggestively depicting La Fontaine’s “The Miller, His Son, and the Ass.”
The autobiographical dimension is furthered by Meissonier’s inclusion of works he had created or owned. Painter Showing His Drawings, set in the quai Bourbon studio,3 includes an enlarged Samson Battling the Philistines, perhaps hinting that the artist is similarly an inspired hero, coping with his own philistine world. Identifiable below is the unframed Smoker of 1842; in the center, The Evangelists, which is propped against a portrait recognizably of Meissonier; and in the portfolio, a drawing for The Evangelists (Musée du Louvre, rf 1908). In the background of Painting Collectors is also an enlarged version of the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence used in the Painter in His Studio of 1843 and an Italian-school painting of a half-length, seminude woman that belonged to Meissonier.4
These references, however, far from being secret, are little jokes in which the collector would surely have been welcome to share: Painter Showing His Drawings, which treats the elegantly attired visitor sympathetically, posing him unconsciously raising his hand to his chin and looking with rapt attention at a page the artist has withdrawn from a portfolio, was purchased by one of Meissonier’s most flattering collectors, Lord Hertford (see Chapter 5), and several reviewers of the Salon of 1850-1 noted Meissonier’s self-portrait.5 Allowing the collector to smile with Meissonier at the artist’s discomfiture defuses any unpleasant subtext, foregrounding the collector’s homage rather than the artist’s subservience.
A number of paintings feature a subspecialization in landscape that originated in Meissonier’s design work for Curmer and in his early close friendships with Daubigny and Français, with whom he had collaborated on landscape paintings and etchings.6 Anticipating the Impressionists’ celebration of light effects and themes of relaxation at resorts outside Paris, he had introduced landscape into his painting repertoire with his Game of Boules, shown in 1848. Depicting elegant, eighteenth-century players in the gardens at Versailles, it was succeeded at the Salon of 1850-1 by Sunday, the Quoits Players, described as a suburban pleasure garden sheltered from the sun by a trellis, with participants who included local villagers, off-duty militiamen, and strolling bourgeois couples.7 In 1853 he showed a Landscape, together with “In the Shade of a Grove Sings a Young Poet” (Fig. 32). The latter, begun around 1850, depicts a sort of fête galante set in Meissonier’s garden at Pois-sy, with figures in sixteenth-century costumes.8 The title came from a poem expressing admiration of the painting, by friend Charles Reynaud.9"

Informed by his horseback excursions to the forests near Poissy, Meis-sonier’s landscapes in the 1860s usually focus on figures, typically horsemen taking a refreshing drink in the saddle at a village or forest inn, as in Cavaliers Being Served a Drink (Exposition Universelle, 1867, Fig. 33). They also feature the play of sunlight. In The Inn Door in the Saint-Germain Forest (i860, Fig. 34) sunlight casts strongly contrasted shadows from figures, projecting architectural details like the shutters and porch, and trees unseen outside the picture; the angle suggests a thirsty time like the end of the day. Fight also shines on and through colors, here intensifying the brilliance of the pink-coated gentleman on his pure white horse and the corresponding pink parasol of the woman strolling on the far right. In “In the Shade of a Grove.. the light breaks irregularly through the canopy of foliage."

Depicting readily understood activities, Meissonier’s scenes do not require the viewer to be familiar with literary or historical sources. His narratives are minimal, suspended in moments of indefinite length. Rather than physical actions, they involve states of mind that can be read in the facial expressions and body language of the figures. Thus the relaxed but total preoccupation of the youth who, pen in hand, searches for his next words in Young Man Working (see Fig. 24) is focused by the way he absentmindedly nibbles his little finger, a detail centered in the image. Likewise, as critics explained, what makes The Confidence (see Fig. 26) so engaging is the contrast between the listener, his gaze fixed as he struggles to pay attention over the last glass of wine, and his oblivious companion who reads to him from a letter or manuscript. The former, legs crossed and right hand dangling limply, slides down against the table and props his head up; the reader in his enthusiasm reaches forward to tap insistently the other’s arm, while his legs and feet suggest he is about to leap from his chair.
Meissonier reinforced the persuasiveness and normalcy of his subjects by painting models with ordinary-looking faces. His figures are clean and dressed"

in neat and	sober suits or the finer pastel and embroidered brocades	of	courtiers, but they occupy less	splendid rooms, comfortably jumbled. Placed	in the
empty foreground are mundane details, things that need to be picked up, like the crumpled paper and feather broken from a pen in Young Man Working or the green leaf fallen from the fruit plate in The Confidence. In Cavaliers Being Served a Drink (see Fig. 33) chickens scratch in the road, and in The Inn Door in the Saint-Germain Forest (see Fig. 34), the prettily costumed horseman is juxtaposed with a heap of fresh horse droppings, while in the near	right corner	two dogs sniff each other intimately.
Though	accessible to	a broad audience through their subjects,	and even
touched with mild humor, Meissonier’s genre paintings are nonetheless distanced from the common in several ways. Chief among these is his situating of subjects in the past, especially the eighteenth century, turning back with a kind of Romantic escapism to the France that was swept away by the Revolution of 1789, to the era that Gautier called the “good old days . . . [that] evoke a tender smile.”10 Though removed, this era was not as discontinuous with present experience as the Middle Ages: As Sabatier-Ungher wrote in 1851, it was the era “of our grandmothers,” preserved in memory, still understandable.11
This choice became more and more distinctive as others in the 1850s and 1860s began to assert the priority of subjects of contemporary life. Despite direct remonstrances, however, Meissonier insisted on his alternative.12 His own era, he argued, lacked the “personal and exclusive” mark that earlier ages possessed. In this “age of railway stations and central markets, the age of universal cast iron,” one was unfortunately left to re-create the achievements of the past. The characteristics that did distinguish the present day were distastefully familiar and cheap, unworthy of capturing. He commented:
There are no readers nowadays. If I had to excuse myself for having multiplied Readers of a past century, I might reply: “They really were numerous in those times, when a man handled his volume daintily, as a lover of good books and fine bindings should do.”
If I were to paint a modern Reader, I should have to put a newspaper in his hand, and to furnish his shelves with pamphlets not worth the trouble of binding, and publications at a franc a volume.
He recalled the eighteenth century nostalgically:
In former times men respected their own persons; they took great pains with their demeanor and thought about it, and had only to stop in a familiar movement to be understood and seized by the artist; in paintings of the time, the graceful gesture, the harmonious stance were not a pose affected temporarily in the artist’s studio; they were natural for the time, an aspect of the good old times! How they merit that name, to my mind!13"
"THE GENRE PAINTINGS OF THE SECOND EMPIRE
Meissonier’s vision of the ancien régime differs notably from that cultivated by many other participants in the eighteenth-century revival that marked much of the nineteenth century.14 From contemporaries in the 1830s and 1840s such as Camille Roqueplan and Eugène Lami to later painters like Renoir or the sculptor Carpeaux, beloved of the Second Empire court whose Empress Eugénie staged dress balls masquerading as Marie-Antoinette, the stereotype was of a rococo fantasy world peopled by frivolous and flirtatious aristocrats. Meissonier himself was well aware of this conception, for around 1843, with Baudelaire, he was among those meeting in the rooms of the painter Fernand Boissard in the Hôtel Pimodan on the Ile-Saint-Louis, gatherings that preserved some of the character of the “Bohème du Doyenné,” which in the 1830s had been a focus of the rococo revival in art and literature. From Boissard’s group, around 1847-8, emerged Mme Sabatier, the demimonde hostess whose Sunday evening salon through the 1850s drew such important connoisseurs and students of the rococo as Gautier, Jules and Edmond Goncourt, and Arsène Houssaye.
Meissonier, a lifelong friend of “Apollonie,” as she was called, posed her for the standing woman in “In the Shade of a Grove...” (see Fig. 32).15 He painted for Mme Sabatier his best-known version of the commedia dell’arte character Polichinelle (Fig. 35), in i860 decorating a door for her eighteenth-century-styled apartment. Even here, however, Meissonier distinguished himself from the froth and wistfulness associated with the rococo, for in contrast to the melancholic Harlequin favored by others - a character Meissonier described as “tender and sentimental” - he singled out the rival Polichinelle, “strong and skeptical.”16 A more troublesome member of the commedia company, Polichinelle is not only duped but is himself a successful duper, at times beaten but also inflicting blows on others, stupid or intelligent, or feigning either condition. Meissonier showed him sturdily astride in his large wooden shoes, his hands complacently crossed on the protuberance at his belly, eyes twinkling roguishly in his wizened face.
Meissonier worked on other paintings like “In the Shade of a Grove. . .,” notably The Poet and a version of The Song, to which he returned in later years.17 These examples, however, all remained in the sketch stage, unsold in his studio. His eighteenth-century images generally eschew scenes of elegant socializing, and in his art women appear infrequently and somewhat awkwardly, as secondary servants or spectators, as in the scenes of cavaliers at inns. Even “In the Shade of a Grove.. .” appears more a comfortable outing among sedate couples than an occasion for flirtation.
His paintings celebrate a realm that is masculine without the sexual or martial violence entailed by historical and mythological subjects; his gentlemen, no matter how finely dressed, project a sense of respectable virtue. Their pleasures lead to self-improvement rather than dissipation; their characters are"
"ERNEST MEISSONIER: MASTER IN HIS GENRE
defined by intelligence and wit rather than emotion; they are moderate rather than extreme in all their interests. For Gautier, Meissonier’s figures had affinities with the “school of good sense” embodied in contemporary literature by François Ponsard and Emile Augier: His were the “honest men” of the eighteenth century.18 Burty similarly characterized the circumscription of their essentially bourgeois detachment:
His readers read attentively the volumes of the Encyclopédie; they are interested in it, they try hard to understand it, but it does not reach beyond their intellect, and the terrible problems that it stirred without resolving them, the immense doubt that it embodied without giving a solution . . . do not enter their minds.19
This vision is particularly noticeable when it subverts a rococo model of licentiousness, as happened in Meissonier’s last major book illustrations and the paintings they inspired, such as A Blacksmith from the Salon of 1861. Around 1856-7 Meissonier produced thirty-four half-page narrative designs for the third edition of the Contes rémois by Louis, comte de Chevigné, published in 1858 by Michel Lévy frères.10 Almost all of Chevigné’s risqué verse stories, set in the eighteenth century, deal with themes of adultery, seduction, deception, and the sexual initiation of the naïve, with only the thinnest veneer of moralization, leading Burty to characterize the volume as the sort kept in “that cabinet in the library to which the family father guards the key in his pocket.”21
Meissonier’s illustrations are relevant to the texts they accompany, but they also depart from them, as he himself acknowledged.22 The illustration to “The Franciscan’s Trousers” (“La Culotte des cordeliers”; Fig. 36) adapts paintings like the 1842 Smoker (see Fig. 3), which Chevigné owned, and beer drinkers in taverns like Three Friends (see Fig. 18) to represent the moment when a cuckolded husband reaches for his money, only to discover that the pants he is wearing are those of another visitor to his wife’s bed. This is a pivotal moment in the plot but less lengthily developed in the poem than is the maneuvering that leads to the husband being fooled into trusting his wife’s innocence, and Meissonier shows the husband no differently than he would any other inn patron paying up. Even more contrary to the text is the illustration for “The Good Doctor” (Fig. 37), which inspired the i860 painting The Cure’s Wine (Fig. 3 8).23 This story concludes with the priest providing his unexpected guest with not only a good dinner and shelter for the night, but also the bedtime company of his maid. Meissonier, however, focused on the two men alone as they savor the last of the wine after a companionable meal.
Meissonier’s eighteenth century, then, is less that of Boucher, Fragonard, or Watteau and more that of Chardin. Indeed, Chardin’s Young Man Draw-"

ing (Stockholm, Nationalmuseum), probably known from an engraving, is the likely inspiration for A Man Drawing of 1855 and Painter at His Easel (see Fig. 28). As Gautier remarked in 1862, himself making the analogy to Chardin, Meissonier showed “the chaste, ordered, and bourgeois” side of the eighteenth century, not that of amorous marquises.24 He portrayed an eighteenth century in which nineteenth-century middle-class viewers could see themselves foretold, in the most agreeable terms.
Despite his historicizing, Meissonier never broke entirely with his own century. He believed it possible for a modern painter to express the qualities of the past truthfully if he went beyond mere casual visits to the library and immersed himself in a given period, and he asserted that, because of his sensibility and the thoroughness of his research efforts, he had entered into the spirit of the past times he represented. He declared, “My house and my temperament both belong to another age!”25 and the property at Poissy and, after 1873-4, his Paris mansion on the boulevard Malesherbes were built and rebuilt to provide settings he could then paint scrupulously.26 The interior room with its hanging tapestry, great stone fireplace, and the mullioned window giving a glimpse of red-brick wall, seen repeatedly in scenes of the 1850s and 1860s (see, e.g., Young Man Working, Fig. 24; Flute Player, Fig. 25; Chess Players, Plate II; and End of a Gambling Quarrel, Fig. 45), is Meisso-nier’s still-extant main studio at Poissy; On the Terrace of 1867 (Fig. 39) is set on the adjoining half-walled upper terrace.
However, Meissonier also insisted that the artist must work from nature and defer to whatever absolute truth nature might dictate. He worked directly from real models, often friends or his son, and later a few chosen employees. He reportedly liked, without preconception, to let a model assume his own natural pose, which he would observe and then associate with an appropriate epoch, but his models inescapably betray their nineteenth-century origins.27 Though when speaking of the natural grace of the “good old days” Meissonier commented, “You will scarcely ever, in an old picture, see people cross-legged as you constantly do in modern ones,” in The Confidence (see Fig. 26) the ostensibly eighteenth-century listener lounges casually onto the table, legs crossed.28 It was precisely because Meissonier’s psychological characterizations were so true to “the people amidst whom he lives” - that is, modern times - that an appreciative Théodore Duret, excusing even the small scale and precise detail as authentic to the artist’s personal instinct, objected to Meissonier’s use of costumes from the past.29
Together with his paintings of eighteenth-century bourgeois subjects, Meissonier early developed a second genre specialization comprising scenes of more convivial, at times unruly, soldiers and cavaliers, also set in the past but usually the seventeenth century of Louis XIII. Introduced with his Guardroom of the Salon of 1845 and Halberd-Bearer of 1849 (Fig. 40), this category"

includes Bravoes (Salon of 1852, Fig. 41) and other panels showing one or two swordsmen, perhaps inspecting a weapon or posing as though on guard duty, as in The Captain (Fig. 42), shown at the Exposition Universelle of 1867 and reproduced in the Gazette des beaux-arts by Charles Blanc; The Laughing Man of 1865 (Fig. 43), On the Terrace (see Fig. 39), and, as late as 1880, Gentleman Curling His Moustache (Paris, Musée d’Orsay). Sometimes such characters strum a lute and sing while off duty, as in Song (1865, Dublin, National Gallery of Ireland). They gather together in multifigure scenes of card playing and drinking in guardrooms and taverns.30
Psychological characterization is still usually the focus: In Innocents and Sly Ones of 1861 (Fig. 44) two novices hesitate over which cards to lay down, while around them old hands await their decision. There is a stronger narrative element in some examples, such as Bravoes (see Fig. 41), which shows two hired assassins with swords drawn, stalking their victim, one spying through a keyhole and motioning to his companion to wait.

ally violence has broken out, as in End of a Gambling Quarrel (Fig. 45), where the furniture is overturned, one chair projecting to the very picture surface, and the cards are strewn on the floor. One fallen player clutches his chest in agony, while his opponent sprawls diagonally, his hand limp beside a sword.
As with his other genre paintings, even these scenes are relatively static, but in one case Meissonier choreographed a scene of dramatic movement: This was A Brawl (Fig. 46). The largest painting Meissonier had then executed, it depicts two men straining to attack each other, while three others intervene, grasping one antagonist around the chest and seeking to wrench away his dagger, pushing back and shielding the other.

usual challenge, and Meissonier began with a rare preliminary sketch (Private Collection).31
Such cavaliers are scarcely surrogate bourgeois, but they still speak to middle-class tastes. Like the eighteenth-century figures, they stop short of coarseness, being clean, well groomed, and personable, sometimes even dandyish in lace collars and ribbons. In contrast to the subdued and natural demeanor of the ancien régime gentlemen, these less temperate swordsmen often seem melodramatic: scowling, singing exaggeratedly, their gestures, as in A Brawl or The Laughing Man, outflung, as though they were acting on a stage. They derive from and capitalize on the popularity of the romantic swashbuckling heroics of novels like Alain-René Lesage’s Gil Bias, a book for which Meissonier expressed great affection,32 and the writings of contemporaries like Alexandre Dumas père, whose The Three Musketeers was published as a novel in 1844 and performed as a play in 1845, the year of the first guardroom painting.
Meissonier became friendly with several theater personalities, notably Emile Augier, embodiment of the “bourgeois theater,” author of both historical plays and ones dealing with modern society, especially the impact of money thereon. In 1852 Meissonier designed costumes for Augier’s Diane, set in 1633 and starring Mile. Rachel, and he perhaps also did costumes for L’Aventurière, first performed in 1849. Augier reciprocated by dedicating his 1855 Mariage d’Olympe to “My Friend Ernest Meissonier.”33 Meissonier was also good friends with playwright Alexandre Dumas fils, who was the first owner of Meissonier’s 1866 watercolor of an eighteenth-century gentleman called “Turcaret,” a financier in Lesage’s 1709 play of the same name (Kansas City, Missouri, Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum).34
Several collectors also encouraged Meissonier’s involvement with the theater, among them Henri Didier (1823-68), a Second Empire legislator involved with a number of sometimes notorious literary and theatrical figures.35 For Didier Meissonier painted The Incredible (L’Incroyable) (Fig. 47), showing an exaggeratedly fashionable dandy of the Directory period. Meissonier wrote to Dumas in October 1858 that he was three years overdue in delivering this work and, having promised it by the end of the month, needed information for the posters on the wall in the background. Specifically he asked for the names of plays that were the rage at different theaters of the period and “whether [the posters] were as large as today; whether it was already customary to give the names of the stars.”36 The finished painting is replete with legible references to plays, theaters, actors, and dancers active during the Revolution, one poster giving the specific date of “10 fructidor, An IV.” Gréty’s Anacréon plays at the Théâtre de la République et des Arts, Le Prisonnier at the Théâtre de l’Opéra Comique National, Epicharis et Né-"
